# The Machairan Holy Bible App

An offline Bible and Bible Study Tool for Windows

# Description

I couldn't find an offline Bible app for Windows that is lightweight and have note taking features. So I decided to (in God's name) use the God given gift for programming by making an app.

Machairan is the greek word for Sword found in Ephesians 6:17 
"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword (Machairan) of the Spirit, which is the word of God:"

# Tech Stack

The Machairan Holy Bible App will be built using Rust-lang
